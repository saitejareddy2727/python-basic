Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since 
the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release 
of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
 of Lorem Ipsum.

  Regarded as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, 
  particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[7] He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day
   International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI
    cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.[8] In limited overs cricket,
    he is an attacking player.[9] He holds the record for the fastest ODI fifty (16 balls), fastest ODI century (31 balls), and fastest 
    ODI 150 (62 balls).
